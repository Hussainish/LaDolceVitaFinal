## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Hussainish/LaDolceVitaFinal.git
   ```
   2.**Rename Project Directory** : Make sure to name the project folder whatever suits you or you can keep the same name it has.
3. **Setup Database**:
   - Import the `restaurant.sql` file from the `db` directory into MySQL or you can run `DB.php` once for minimal dabase creation - if you want you can update the database name in `DB.php` so that the newly created database will have the name you want.
   - In case you are using wampserver, you can create a database in `phpmyadmin` and then import `restaurant.sql` from the `db` directory.
   - Update the `config/config.php` file with your database credentials.

3. **Run the Project Locally**:
   - Install a local server like **XAMPP** or **WampServer**.
   - Place the project in the server directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP and `www` for wampserver).
   - Start Apache and MySQL (in case you're using wampserver simply run wampserver on your machine) .
   - Access the site at `http://localhost/LaDolceVitaFinal` in case you kept the folder name or `http://localhost/yourfoldername` in case you changed it.
